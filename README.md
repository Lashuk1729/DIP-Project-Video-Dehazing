# DIP-Project-Video-Dehazing
We shall be working on "Simultaneous Video Defogging and Stereo Reconstruction" Paper which was written in 2015. This process jointly estimate scene depth and recover the clear latent image from a foggy video sequence. We shall be using MRF framework to enforce the ordering consistency between scene depth and fog transmission at neighboring points, which is optimized iteratively by introducing auxiliary variables.

We have used the following link as our inspiration: http://www.lizhuwen.com/pages/Stereo%20in%20Fog.html
